# CSC 580 - Applying Machine Learning and Neural Networks (Captsone)
**Disclaimer:** These projects were built as a requirement for CSC 580: Applying Machine Learning and Neural Networks at Colorado State University Global under the instruction of Dr. Brian Holbert. Unless otherwise noted, all programs were created to adhere to explicit guidelines as outlined in the assignment requirements I was given. Descriptions of each [programming assignment](#programming-assignments) and the [portfolio project](#portfolio-project) can be found below.

*****This class is in progress and the respository will be updated as assignments are completed.*****

### Textbooks
The required textbook for this class was [**TensorFlow for Deep Learning: From Linear Regression to Reinforcement Learning**](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/tensorflow-for-deep/9781491980446/) by **Bharath Ramsundar & Reza Bosagh Zadeh**

The optional textbook for this class was [**Deep Learning Pipeline: Building a Deep Learning Model with TensorFlow**](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/deep-learning-pipeline/9781484253496/) by **Hisham El-Amir & Mahmoud Hamdy**
### VS Code Comment Anchors Extension
I am using the [Comment Anchors extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ExodiusStudios.comment-anchors) for Visual Studio Code which places anchors within comments to allow for easy navigation and the ability to track TODO's, code reviews, etc. You may find the following tags intersperesed throughout the code in this repository: ANCHOR, TODO, FIXME, STUB, NOTE, REVIEW, SECTION, LINK, CELL, FUNCTION, CLASS

For anyone using this extension, please note that CELL, FUNCTION, and CLASS are tags I defined myself.

### (WIP) Critical Thinking 1: [Basic Facial Recognition Program](CT%201)
- A python script to perform basic facial recognition in an image and draw a red bounding box around detected faces
- Utilizes the [facial_recognition](https://pypi.org/project/face-recognition/) and [PIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Imaging_Library) libraries
