    "## CSC 580: Critical Thinking 2 - Predicting Future Sales\n",
    "In a nutshell, *sales_data_test.csv* and *sales_data_test.csv* contain data that will be used to train a neural network to predict how much money can be expected form the future sale of new video games. The .csv files were retrieved from one of [Toni Esteves repos](https://github.com/toniesteves/adam-geitgey-building-deep-learning-keras/tree/master/03). \n",
    "\n",
    "The columns in the data are defined as follows:\n",
    "- critic_rating : an average rating out of five stars\n",
    "- is_action : tells us if this was an action game\n",
    "- is_exclusive_to_us : tells us if we have an exclusiv deal to sell this game\n",
    "- is_portable : tells us if this game runs on a handheld video game system\n",
    "- is_role_playing : tells us if this is a role-playing game\n",
    "- is_sequel : tells us if this game was a sequel to an earlier video game and part of an ongoing series\n",
    "- is_sports : tells us if this was a sports game\n",
    "- suitable_for_kids : tells us if this game is appropriate for all ages\n",
    "- total_earning : tells us how much money the store has earned in total from selling the game to all customers\n",
    "- unit_price : tells us for how much a single copy of the game retailed"
